    service_name="forecast_service",
    service_type="forecasting",
    endpoint="http://localhost:8001",
    capabilities=["forecast", "model", "time_series"]
)

# Route a request
response = await mesh.route_request(
    RequestType.FORECAST,
    {"symbol": "AAPL", "horizon": 7},
    strategy="least_loaded"
)
