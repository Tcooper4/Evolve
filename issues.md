       def schedule_task(self, task):
           # Task scheduling logic
           pass

       def coordinate_agents(self):
           # Agent coordination logic
           pass

       def track_progress(self):
           # Progress tracking logic
           pass
   ```

2. **Code Generation Agent**
   ```python
   class CodeGenerationAgent:
       def __init__(self):
           self.templates = {}
           self.requirements = {}

       def generate_code(self, specification):
           # Code generation logic
           pass

       def refactor_code(self, code):
           # Code refactoring logic
           pass
   ```

3. **Testing Agent**
   ```python
   class TestingAgent:
       def __init__(self):
           self.test_suites = {}
           self.results = {}

       def generate_tests(self, component):
           # Test generation logic
           pass

       def execute_tests(self, test_suite):
           # Test execution logic
           pass
   ```

### Usage Instructions
1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/evolve_clean.git

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Configure AI agents
   python setup_agents.py

   # Start development pipeline
   python start_pipeline.py
   ```

2. **Adding New Features**
   ```python
   # Create feature specification
   feature = {
       "name": "risk_management",
       "components": [...],
       "requirements": [...],
       "dependencies": [...]
   }

   # Submit to pipeline
   pipeline.submit_feature(feature)
   ```

3. **Monitoring Progress**
   ```python
   # Check pipeline status
   status = pipeline.get_status()

   # View progress
   progress = pipeline.get_progress()

   # Check results
   results = pipeline.get_results()
   ```
