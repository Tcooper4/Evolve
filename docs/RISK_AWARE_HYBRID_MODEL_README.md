# Risk-Aware Hybrid Model

## Overview

The Risk-Aware Hybrid Model is an enhanced ensemble forecasting system that uses risk-aware weighting instead of traditional MSE-based weighting. It allows users to select between Sharpe ratio, drawdown, or MSE as the primary weighting metric, making the ensemble more risk-aware and better suited for trading applications.

## Key Features

### üéØ **Risk-Aware Weighting**

1. **Sharpe Ratio Weighting**
   - Formula: `weight = Sharpe / total_Sharpe`
   - Favors models with better risk-adjusted returns
   - Ideal for maximizing risk-adjusted performance

2. **Drawdown Weighting**
   - Formula: `weight = (1 + drawdown) / total`
   - Favors models with lower maximum drawdown
   - Ideal for risk-averse strategies

3. **MSE Weighting**
   - Formula: `weight = (1/MSE) / total(1/MSE)`
   - Traditional accuracy-based weighting
   - Favors models with lower prediction error

### üìä **Enhanced Performance Metrics**

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return calculation
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable predictions
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Worst peak-to-trough decline
- **MSE**: Mean squared error for accuracy
- **Total Return**: Cumulative return from predictions

### üéõÔ∏è **User-Selectable Configuration**

- Interactive weighting metric selection
- Configurable thresholds and floors
- Real-time weight updates
- Performance visualization
- Configuration validation

4. **Composite**: Trend-adjusted scoring

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from trading.forecasting.hybrid_model import HybridModel

# Create models dictionary
models = {
    "LSTM": lstm_model,
    "XGBoost": xgb_model,
    "Transformer": transformer_model
}

# Initialize hybrid model
hybrid_model = HybridModel(models)

# Fit models and calculate performance
hybrid_model.fit(data)

# Set weighting metric
hybrid_model.set_weighting_metric("sharpe")  # "sharpe", "drawdown", or "mse"

# Make predictions
predictions = hybrid_model.predict(data)
```

### Streamlit Integration

```python
import streamlit as st
from trading.ui.hybrid_model_config import render_hybrid_model_config_sidebar

# Render configuration in sidebar
config = render_hybrid_model_config_sidebar(hybrid_model)

# Use the configured model
if st.button("Run Prediction"):
    prediction = hybrid_model.predict(data)
    st.line_chart(prediction)
```

## Weighting Metrics

### Sharpe Ratio Weighting

**Formula**: `weight = Sharpe / total_Sharpe`

**Advantages**:
- Maximizes risk-adjusted returns
- Accounts for both return and volatility
- Industry standard for performance evaluation

**Best For**:

- Risk-adjusted performance optimization
- Institutional trading

**Configuration**:
```python
hybrid_model.scoring_config["sharpe_floor"] = 0.0  # Minimum Sharpe ratio
```

### Drawdown Weighting

**Formula**: `weight = (1 + drawdown) / total`

**Advantages**:
- Minimizes portfolio risk
- Protects against large losses
- Conservative approach

**Best For**:
- Risk-averse strategies
- Capital preservation
- Conservative portfolios

**Configuration**:
```python
hybrid_model.scoring_config["drawdown_ceiling"] = -0.5  # Maximum drawdown
```

### MSE Weighting

**Formula**: `weight = (1/MSE) / total(1/MSE)`

**Advantages**:
- Traditional accuracy-based approach
- Simple and intuitive
- Good for prediction accuracy

**Best For**:
- Pure forecasting applications
- Academic research
- When accuracy is primary concern

**Configuration**:

    "min_performance_threshold": 0.1, # Minimum performance to avoid zero weights
    "recency_weight": 0.7,            # Weight for recent vs historical performance
    "risk_free_rate": 0.02,           # Risk-free rate for Sharpe calculations

```python
# Use Sharpe ratio weighting for risk-adjusted growth
hybrid_model.set_weighting_metric("sharpe")
hybrid_model.scoring_config["sharpe_floor"] = 0.5  # Higher minimum Sharpe

# This will favor models with better risk-adjusted returns
```

### Scenario 3: Pure Forecasting

```python
# Use MSE weighting for accuracy-focused applications
hybrid_model.set_weighting_metric("mse")
hybrid_model.scoring_config["mse_ceiling"] = 500.0  # Lower MSE threshold

# This will favor models with lower prediction error
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Backtester Integration

```python
from trading.backtesting.backtester import Backtester

# Create hybrid model
hybrid_model = HybridModel(models)
hybrid_model.set_weighting_metric("sharpe")

# Use in backtester
backtester = Backtester(data=data, initial_cash=100000)
# ... run backtest with hybrid model predictions
```

### Strategy Pipeline Integration

```python
from trading.strategies.strategy_pipeline import StrategyPipeline

# Create strategy pipeline with hybrid model
pipeline = StrategyPipeline()
pipeline.add_hybrid_model(hybrid_model)

# Run with risk-aware weighting
results = pipeline.run_backtest(data)
```
