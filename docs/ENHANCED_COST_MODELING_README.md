## Architecture

### Core Components

```
trading/backtesting/
â”œâ”€â”€ performance_analysis.py    # Enhanced performance analyzer with cost modeling
â”œâ”€â”€ cost_model.py             # Comprehensive cost model with multiple fee structures
â””â”€â”€ backtester.py             # Updated backtester with cost integration

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from trading.backtesting.performance_analysis import PerformanceAnalyzer, CostParameters
from trading.backtesting.backtester import Backtester
from trading.backtesting.cost_model import CostModel, CostConfig

# Define cost parameters
cost_params = CostParameters(
    commission_rate=0.001,    # 0.1% commission
    slippage_rate=0.002,      # 0.2% slippage
    spread_rate=0.0005,       # 0.05% spread
    cash_drag_rate=0.02,      # 2% annual cash drag
    enable_cost_adjustment=True
)

# Create cost model
cost_config = CostConfig(
    fee_rate=cost_params.commission_rate,
    slippage_rate=cost_params.slippage_rate,
    spread_rate=cost_params.spread_rate
)
cost_model = CostModel(cost_config, data)

# Initialize backtester with cost model
backtester = Backtester(
    data=data,
    initial_cash=100000,
    cost_model=cost_model
)

# Run backtest and analyze performance
performance_analyzer = PerformanceAnalyzer(cost_params)
metrics = performance_analyzer.compute_metrics(equity_df, trade_log_df)
```

### Streamlit UI Integration

```python
import streamlit as st
from trading.ui.cost_config import render_cost_config_sidebar, CostConfigUI

# Render cost configuration in sidebar
cost_params = render_cost_config_sidebar(
    config_ui=CostConfigUI(show_advanced=True),
    default_params=CostParameters()
)

# Use cost parameters in backtest
if st.button("Run Backtest"):
    # Your backtesting code here
    pass
```

## Cost Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Simple Trade

```python
# Trade: Buy 100 shares at $50
trade_value = 100 * 50 = $5,000

# Costs:
commission = max($1, min($5,000 * 0.001, $1,000)) = $5
slippage = $5,000 * 0.002 = $10
spread = $5,000 * 0.0005 = $2.50

total_cost = $5 + $10 + $2.50 = $17.50
cost_percentage = ($17.50 / $5,000) * 100 = 0.35%
```

### Example 2: Large Trade

```python
# Trade: Buy 10,000 shares at $50
trade_value = 10,000 * 50 = $500,000

# Costs:
commission = max($1, min($500,000 * 0.001, $1,000)) = $1,000
slippage = $500,000 * 0.002 = $1,000
spread = $500,000 * 0.0005 = $250

total_cost = $1,000 + $1,000 + $250 = $2,250
cost_percentage = ($2,250 / $500,000) * 100 = 0.45%
```

## UI Components

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Backtester Integration

The enhanced cost modeling integrates seamlessly with the existing backtester:

```python
# Existing backtester usage remains the same
backtester = Backtester(data=data, initial_cash=100000)

# Add cost model for realistic costs
cost_model = CostModel(cost_config, data)
backtester.cost_model = cost_model

# Performance analysis automatically includes cost adjustments
metrics = backtester.get_performance_metrics()
```

### Strategy Pipeline Integration

Cost modeling works with all existing strategies:

```python
from trading.strategies.strategy_pipeline import StrategyPipeline

# Create strategy pipeline
pipeline = StrategyPipeline()

# Add strategies (costs are automatically applied)
pipeline.add_strategy("moving_average", ma_params)
pipeline.add_strategy("rsi", rsi_params)

# Run with cost adjustment
results = pipeline.run_backtest(data, cost_params=cost_params)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Cost Parameter Selection

- **Start Conservative**: Use higher cost estimates initially
- **Market-Specific**: Adjust costs based on asset class and market conditions
- **Volume-Based**: Consider volume impact on slippage
- **Regime-Dependent**: Adjust costs for different market regimes

### 2. Performance Analysis

- **Compare Scenarios**: Always compare with and without costs
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test different cost parameter combinations
- **Cost Attribution**: Understand which costs have the biggest impact
- **Break-Even Analysis**: Determine minimum returns needed to cover costs

### 3. Strategy Optimization

- **Frequency Impact**: Consider how trading frequency affects costs
- **Position Sizing**: Optimize position sizes to minimize cost impact
- **Execution Timing**: Consider market timing to reduce slippage
- **Portfolio Construction**: Balance diversification with cost efficiency

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High-Frequency Trading

```python
cost_params = CostParameters(
    commission_rate=0.0001,  # 0.01%
    slippage_rate=0.0005,    # 0.05%
    spread_rate=0.0001,      # 0.01%
    cash_drag_rate=0.01      # 1%
)
```

**Key Considerations:**
- Low commission rates
- Minimal slippage due to small trade sizes
- High turnover requires efficient execution
- Cash drag is minimized through high utilization

### Scenario 2: Long-Term Investing

```python
cost_params = CostParameters(
    commission_rate=0.001,   # 0.1%
    slippage_rate=0.002,     # 0.2%
    spread_rate=0.0005,      # 0.05%
    cash_drag_rate=0.02      # 2%
)
```

**Key Considerations:**
- Higher commission rates acceptable due to infrequent trading
- Slippage less critical due to longer holding periods
- Cash drag more significant due to larger cash positions
- Focus on long-term cost efficiency

### Scenario 3: Institutional Trading

```python
cost_params = CostParameters(
    commission_rate=0.0005,  # 0.05%
    slippage_rate=0.001,     # 0.1%
    spread_rate=0.0002,      # 0.02%
    cash_drag_rate=0.015     # 1.5%
)
```

**Key Considerations:**
- Negotiated commission rates
- Sophisticated execution to minimize slippage
- Large trade sizes require careful execution
- Professional cash management

## Testing and Validation

### Unit Tests

Run the test suite to validate cost calculations:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_cost_modeling.py -v
```

### Example Script

Run the comprehensive example:

```bash
