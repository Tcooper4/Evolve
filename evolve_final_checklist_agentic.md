# 🧠 Agentic Forecasting Tool – Final Completion Checklist (Autonomous, Quant-Grade)

This checklist goes beyond code quality. It brings your system to full **agentic intelligence**, making it as powerful and adaptable as a quant PM.

---

## 🔧 1. Code Quality & Modular Architecture

### 🟩 1.1 Structure, Readability, and Testing
- [ ] All functions and classes have docstrings
- [ ] All functions use type hints
- [ ] Logging replaces all `print()` usage with proper levels (`info`, `error`, `debug`)
- [ ] All `except:` clauses are replaced with `except Exception as e:` or specific types
- [ ] Split monolithic files (e.g., `unified_interface.py`) into modular subcomponents
- [ ] Separate fallback classes into their own folder/module (`fallback/`)
- [ ] All utilities consolidated under `utils/` and fully tested

---

## 🧠 2. Agentic Intelligence Core

### 🟩 2.1 Prompt Agent
- [ ] Fully interprets freeform prompts into routing logic (forecast, strategy, report)
- [ ] Logs decision paths and fallback resolutions
- [ ] Handles edge cases and unknown inputs gracefully

### 🟩 2.2 Model Selection Agent
- [ ] Supports ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, Prophet
- [ ] Adds GARCH, Ridge, Transformer (sequence-based or huggingface)
- [ ] Tracks MSE per model over time
- [ ] Dynamically selects best model per asset/timeframe
- [ ] Supports model ensembles (weighted or voting-based)

### 🟩 2.3 Strategy Selection Agent
- [ ] Supports RSI, MACD, Bollinger, SMA
- [ ] Adds CCI, ATR, Stochastic, Trend Filters, Mean Reversion logic
- [ ] Selects best strategy using Sharpe, win rate, drawdown
- [ ] Automatically tunes thresholds via GridSearch or Optuna

### 🟩 2.4 Regime Detection Agent
- [ ] Uses HMM, volatility filters, or clustering to detect market regime
- [ ] Changes models and strategies based on regime state
- [ ] Logs detected regime and confidence level

---

## 📈 3. Forecasting, Execution & Backtesting

### ✅ 3.1 Forecast Layer
- [x] Forecast engine works with Prophet, ARIMA, XGBoost, LSTM
- [ ] Add Ridge, GARCH, Transformer support
- [ ] Ensemble forecaster that chooses best or blends models
- [ ] Include confidence intervals in forecasts

### 🟩 3.2 Strategy Engine
- [x] Current indicators work (RSI, MACD, etc.)
- [ ] Dynamic strategy tuner using hyperopt or Optuna
- [ ] Combines strategies into multi-factor logic
- [ ] Adds position sizing (e.g. Kelly, fixed %, volatility-adjusted)

### 🟩 3.3 Backtest + Metrics
- [ ] Unified trade reporting engine with equity curve, trades, metrics
- [ ] Add Sharpe, Max Drawdown, Win %, Profit Factor
- [ ] Supports export to CSV, PDF
- [ ] Backtests automatically run on forecasted signals

---

## 🧠 4. LLM & Commentary System

### 🟩 4.1 LLM Integration
- [x] GPT-4 and Hugging Face supported
- [ ] Automatically detects available LLM and routes
- [ ] Commentary agent explains trades, forecasts, and strategies
- [ ] GPT-based “decision explainer” per trade or regime switch

---

## 🚀 5. UI, Deployment & Auto-Reliability

### 🟩 5.1 Streamlit or API Interface
- [ ] Finalize multi-tab layout with Forecast, Strategy, Backtest, Report
- [ ] Add prompt input and confidence visualization
- [ ] Add download/export button

### 🟨 5.2 Resilience
- [ ] All modules support fallback on failure
- [ ] System logs all fallback and agentic decisions
- [ ] Startup diagnostics: check model, data, internet, API

### 🟨 5.3 Deployment Readiness
- [ ] Add Dockerfile or `requirements.txt` for consistent builds
- [ ] Secure API key handling (for OpenAI, Finnhub, etc.)
- [ ] `.env.example` included and documented
- [ ] Clean separation of local vs cloud behavior
