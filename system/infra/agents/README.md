# Infrastructure Agents

This directory contains agents responsible for system orchestration, automation, and infrastructure management.

## Structure

- `scheduler.py` - Task scheduling and execution
- `alert_manager.py` - Alert handling and notification
- `automation_agent.py` - Automated task execution
- `system_monitor.py` - System health monitoring
- `infra_router.py` - Infrastructure task routing

## Agent Types

1. **Scheduling Agents**
   - Daily task scheduling
   - Periodic job execution
   - Task prioritization
   - Resource allocation

2. **Monitoring Agents**
   - System health checks
   - Performance monitoring
   - Resource utilization
   - Error detection

3. **Automation Agents**
   - Automated deployments
   - Configuration management
   - Backup and recovery
   - System maintenance

## Usage

These agents are designed to work together through the `InfraManager` class, which handles:
- Task scheduling and execution
- System monitoring and alerts
- Resource management
- Automation workflows

## Integration

The infrastructure agents integrate with:
- Scheduling systems (e.g., cron, APScheduler)
- Monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
- Alert systems (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack)
- Configuration management systems
- Deployment pipelines
