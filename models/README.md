# Models Module

The models module contains machine learning models and training infrastructure for the trading platform.

## Structure

```
models/
├── training/        # Model training
├── evaluation/      # Model evaluation
├── deployment/      # Model deployment
└── utils/          # Model utilities
```

## Components

### Training

The `training` directory contains:
- Model training scripts
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model validation

### Evaluation

The `evaluation` directory contains:
- Model performance metrics
- Cross-validation
- Backtesting
- Risk analysis
- Error analysis

### Deployment

The `deployment` directory contains:
- Model serving
- Version control
- A/B testing
- Model monitoring
- Rollback procedures

### Utilities

The `utils` directory contains:
- Data loaders
- Feature extractors
- Model serialization
- Configuration management
- Logging utilities

## Usage

```python
from models.training import ModelTrainer
from models.evaluation import ModelEvaluator
from models.deployment import ModelDeployer
from models.utils import DataLoader

# Train a model
trainer = ModelTrainer()
model = trainer.train(data)

# Evaluate model
evaluator = ModelEvaluator()
metrics = evaluator.evaluate(model)

# Deploy model
deployer = ModelDeployer()
deployer.deploy(model)
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run model tests
pytest tests/unit/models/

# Run specific component tests
pytest tests/unit/models/training/
pytest tests/unit/models/evaluation/
