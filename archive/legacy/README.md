# Legacy Files Archive

This directory contains legacy files that have been moved from the main codebase to prevent conflicts and maintain a clean project structure.

## Moved Files

### Scripts
- `scripts/cleanup_agents.py` - Legacy agent cleanup script
- `scripts/manage_backup.py` - Legacy backup management script

### Automate
- `automate/daily_scheduler.py` - Legacy daily scheduling automation

### Core
- `core/agents/base_agent.py` - Legacy base agent implementation

## Reason for Moving

These files were moved to archive because:
1. They contain outdated or unused functionality
2. They may conflict with newer implementations
3. They are no longer actively maintained
4. They have been replaced by more modern alternatives

## Usage

If you need to reference these files for historical purposes or to extract specific functionality, they are available in this archive. However, it is recommended to use the current implementations in the main codebase instead.

## Restoration

To restore any of these files, simply move them back to their original location. However, be aware that they may not be compatible with the current codebase and may require updates.
